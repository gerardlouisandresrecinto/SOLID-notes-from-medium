SOLID - first 5 principles of OOD w/ php
S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP or syrup)
O - Open/closed principle (OCP)
L - Liskov Sub Principle (LSP)
I - Interface Segregation principle (ISP)
D - Dependency inversion principle (DIP)

1. SRP - single responsibility for class/module
class/module should solve only 1 problem
example of Logger class: break SRP b/c it collected and saved logs.
have a logger class and logStorage class so each has 1 responsibility

2. OCP - well-tested class should not be modified when new feature needs to be built
need to extend class/interface in a new class to add new features
“Software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”
